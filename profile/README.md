# Who we are

![Infrastructure, Operations & Networking](https://its.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2014/07/command-center-1024-537.jpg)

This github organization is maintained by team of DEVOPS engineers within [UNC Information Technology Services](https://its.unc.edu) and [Infrastructure, Operations & Networking](https://its.unc.edu/about-us/what-we-do/it-infrastructure-operations/).  Tooling is specifically centered on the Networking group but team members have source from various departments over time.  Repositories are hosted here to collaborate and share work with other teams in and out of higher education.

The networking group is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the IT infrastructure for the entire UNC-Chapel Hill campus. Its goal of maintaining and evolving a high-performance, high-availability networking environment positions it to stay ahead of the needs of the faculty, staff and students in their education, research, administration and service missions.
